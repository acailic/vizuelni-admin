# Project Next Steps (Long-Term Plan)

This plan is the long-term execution backlog for vizualni-admin. It is written
so an agent can pick up a task with minimal additional context. Keep items
scoped, specific, and tied to files and tests.

## How to use this plan

- Update status tags: [todo], [doing], [done], [blocked].
- Each work item should include: goal, deliverables, definition of done, key
  files, tests, and dependencies.
- When a decision is required, create a decision record in
  `ai_working/decisions/` using `ai_working/decisions/README-template.md`.

## Guiding objectives

- Publish a reliable library with stable exports and correct dependencies.
- Keep documentation aligned with actual behavior and architecture.
- Protect public API behavior with unit and packaging tests.
- Make map functionality predictable in size and install experience.
- Maintain demos as proof of capability and onboarding.

## Workstreams and key files

- Packaging and exports: `app/package.json`, `app/exports/`,
  `app/tests/exports/`, `app/tests/packaging/`.
- Docs and onboarding: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`,
  `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md`, `docs/release/RELEASE.md`.
- Data.gov.rs integration: `app/domain/data-gov-rs/`,
  `app/hooks/use-data-gov-rs.ts`,
  `app/__tests__/unit/data-gov-rs-client.test.ts`.
- Map and geo: `app/charts/map/`, `app/tests/exports/MapChart.test.tsx`,
  `app/tests/exports/MapChart.integration.test.tsx`.
- Demos: `app/pages/demos/`, `docs/DATASET_VISUALIZATION_PLAN.md`.
- Quality and performance: `scripts/quality-gates.js`,
  `scripts/test-performance.js`, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.

## 0-30 Days: Stabilize and align

- [done] Dependency audit for exported charts and hooks.
  - Goal: ensure `app/package.json` runtime deps cover `app/exports/*` usage.
  - Deliverables: dependency list, updated `app/package.json`, note in
    `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`.
  - Definition of done: `yarn test` passes; packaging tests in
    `app/tests/packaging/` pass without missing deps.
  - Key files: `app/exports/charts/`, `app/exports/hooks/`, `app/package.json`.
  - Tests: `yarn test` (or `cd app && vitest run`).

- [todo] Align dist artifact tests with the exports map.
  - Goal: assert every `app/package.json` export path exists in `app/dist`.
  - Deliverables: update `app/tests/packaging/dist-artifacts.spec.ts` to read
    `app/package.json` and verify files.
  - Definition of done: tests fail if a dist file referenced in `exports` is
    missing.
  - Tests: `yarn test` (after `cd app && npm run build:lib`).

- [done] Documentation alignment with current architecture.
  - Goal: docs reflect actual cache layers, data fetching, and build pipeline.
  - Deliverables: updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
    with current entry points and execution notes.
  - Definition of done: no stale references to removed modules or behaviors.

- [done] Map dependency inventory and decision memo draft.
  - Goal: capture dependency list and decision context for map packaging.
  - Deliverables: inventory of map deps (`maplibre-gl`, `react-map-gl`,
    `@deck.gl/*`, etc), decision record in `ai_working/decisions/`.
  - Definition of done: decision record includes options, criteria, and impact.

- [done] Expand exported chart tests beyond baseline.
  - Goal: cover edge cases not fully exercised (negative values, stacked series,
    label formatting, and empty data).
  - Deliverables: edge-case coverage in `app/tests/exports/charts/` for Bar,
    Column, Pie, Area, and Line charts (empty/null/single/negative/stack).
  - Definition of done: tests capture at least one edge case per chart.

- [done] Expand `useLocale` tests for SSR and hydration behavior.
  - Goal: confirm locale switching works across SSR and hydration boundaries.

    fallback coverage.

## Decisions required (create records in `ai_working/decisions/`)

- MapChart packaging: decided in
  `ai_working/decisions/2026-01-09-mapchart-packaging.md`.
- Documentation source of truth: root docs vs app docs.
  - Evidence needed: contributor workflow and build/publish pipeline impact.
- Export policy: stable vs experimental API.
  - Evidence needed: usage in demos, tests, and external consumers.

## Open questions and assumptions

- Primary audience: internal demos vs external library consumers.
- Whether advanced map functionality (maplibre or Deck.gl) ships by default or
  stays optional.
- Node runtime target remains >= 18.
